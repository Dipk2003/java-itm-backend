## Solution Steps

```

### Step 2: Test OTP with Browser

- Email: test@example.com
- Phone: 9876543210
- Password: test123

### Step 4: What to Look For in Terminal

Verify in `application.properties`:
```properties
sms.simulation.enabled=true
```

Open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/test/send-otp?phone=9876543210
```

### Check 4: Check Logs
Look for these log messages:
- "Simulated SMS sent to: 9876543210 with OTP: 123456"

## Manual Testing Commands

### PowerShell Test
```powershell
# Test 1: Server connection
try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/test/hello" -Method Get
    Write-Host "Server OK: $response"
} catch {
    Write-Host "Server Error: Check if server is running on port 8080"
}

# Test 2: OTP Generation
try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/test/send-otp" -Method Post -Body @{phone="9876543210"}

    Write-Host "Check your terminal for OTP output!"
} catch {
    Write-Host "OTP Error: $($_.Exception.Message)"
}

   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: 9876543210

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: No SMS Output At All
**Solution**: Check if phone number is being passed to backend
- Add console.log in frontend before API call
- Check network tab in browser

### Issue 2: Only Email OTP Visible
**Solution**: SMS service might not be getting called
- Check if both email and phone are provided in registration
- Verify phone number format (should be 10 digits)

### Issue 3: 403 Error on Test Endpoints
**Solution**: Server might not be started properly
- Restart Spring Boot application
- Check if port 8080 is available

### Issue 4: OTP Not Colorful in Terminal
**Solution**: Terminal doesn't support emojis
- Look for text "YOUR OTP IS" instead of 🔥🔥🔥
- Check "OTP ALERT" messages
